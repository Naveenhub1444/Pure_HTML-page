                                    a
                                    nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal temperatures reaching millions of
                                    degrees Celsius. The Sun's immense gravity holds the solar system together and
                                    provides
                                    the energy that sustains life on Earth through the process of photosynthesis. It is

                                    relatively average-sized star, but its energy output is immense, making it the
